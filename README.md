# Bitcoin-NeuralNetwork

## TODO
* __Finish the Example__
* __Find the meaning of the values in the example program__
* Understand how to create a neuralnetwork for analysing values
* Make the system modular so it can be improved in the future
* Make the project properly so it is actually useful

## Working of NeuralNetwork
* First get the data from the database
* Decide the variables that are going to be used to train
* Decide the output prediction varable of the NeuralNetwork
* Normalize the Data
* Run the NeuralNetwork to train the system

## Types of functions available for steps
* Activation Function - softmax,rectified_linear_unit,tanh,sigmoid
